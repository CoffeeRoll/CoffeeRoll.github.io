## Hello World!

This is the first post made on CoffeeRoll.dev. This site is built on [devlopr-jekyll](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll), a portfolio style Jekyll template aimed at developers. 



I'm super new to blogging and am not really sure what I'm doing. It's been a lot of fun customizing this template as I learn the ins and outs of Jekyll. There's way more to this than I had anticipated.

The site has some randomness built-in, in the form of the type-text on the home page. Give it a couple refreshes and see what you get! I plan on adding more little easter eggs like that as I continue to build out this site, but they may not be as obvious - so stay sharp!
